As part of test for my job quest on Mint. This is an implementation of the given design.
Although no design was given for mobile view I improvised. On the charts, there's a horizontal scroll on mobile and tablets. And a menu button to show the other menu items. The payments section uses dummydata as stated. The side bar is only for tablet and desktop screens.

The app uses React, React state etc.
